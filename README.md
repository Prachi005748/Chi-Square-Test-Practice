## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About / Motivation

The goal of this repo is:

- To **learn** and **practice** how to perform a chi-square test (goodness of fit, test of independence, etc.) using Python.
- To **visualize** and **interpret** results (p-values, observed vs expected, degrees of freedom).
- To serve as a reference for how to use Python‚Äôs libraries (e.g. `scipy.stats`, `pandas`) to carry out chi-square analyses.

If you‚Äôre a statistics student, data enthusiast, or just curious ‚Äî this is a simple starting point.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use / Run

1. **Clone / Download** the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prachi005748/Chi-Square-Test-Practice.git
   cd Chi-Square-Test-Practice
Open the notebook:

You‚Äôll need Jupyter (or something like JupyterLab / VSCode‚Äôs notebook support).

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "Chi square test.ipynb"
Install dependencies (if not already installed). In the notebook you might see imports like:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
You can install these via pip or conda, e.g.:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib
Run / Explore:

Observe how the observed data is compared to expected frequencies.

Look at outputs: chi-square statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom.

Check how interpretations are made (rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis).

üîç What‚Äôs Inside / What You‚Äôll Learn
Building contingency tables or frequency tables.

Calculating expected frequencies.

Running the chi-square test via scipy.stats.chisquare (goodness of fit) or scipy.stats.chi2_contingency (test of independence).

Checking assumptions (e.g. minimum expected frequency thresholds).

Visualizing observed vs expected frequencies.

Interpreting p-values, significance levels, and making data-driven conclusions.

‚úÖ Example (Pseudo / extracted from notebook)
Suppose you have:

Category	Observed count
A	50
B	30
C	20

You expect the distribution to be uniform (i.e. ‚Öì each).
In the notebook, you‚Äôd compute:

python
Copy code
from scipy import stats

observed = [50, 30, 20]
expected = [100/3, 100/3, 100/3]

chi2, p = stats.chisquare(f_obs=observed, f_exp=expected)
print("Chi2 statistic:", chi2)
print("p-value:", p)
Then interpret whether the observed distribution significantly deviates from uniform.

üí° Possible Enhancements / Next Steps
Add more example datasets (e.g. real-world contingency tables).

Automate checking of assumptions and warn when they‚Äôre violated.

Add simulations / bootstrapping to validate results.

Build a small GUI / web app where users can input their own frequencies and get the chi-square test result.

Export results / reports as PDF.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Notes
The chi-square test has conditions (e.g. expected frequencies should not be too low). Be careful when some expected counts are < 5 ‚Äî interpretations must be cautious.

The notebook assumes basic knowledge of Python and statistics.

This is for educational / practice use; always verify with domain-appropriate assumptions when you apply to real data.
